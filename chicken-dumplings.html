    <h2>Description</h2>
        <body>It took me a while to dial this one in just right.  I had a memory somewhere in the back of my mind from my Mississippi upbringing of the perfect bowl of chicken n dumplings.  The "drop" style dumplings some folks cook are just not my bag at all.  I wanted noodly dumplings, but thicker and a bit chewier.  I finally discovered that pie crust is the secret to making the dumplings of my dreams.  If you're hardcore you can make your own, but I like the Pillsbury brand refrigerated roll-up crusts a whole lot.  This recipe calls for 1 roll, but you really don't need quite that much unless you're feeding a lot of mouths.  You can also stretch this recipe to be larger and use 2 rolls of pie crust, of course....

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>2 32 oz. containers of chicken broth</li>
    <li>1 roll Pilsbury refrigerated pie crust</li>
    <li>3 stalks celery, chopped</li>
    <li>1 yellow onion, chopped</li>
    <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
    <li>1 cup heavy cream (optional for heartiness)</li>
    <li>1 whole chicken</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>

    <li>1/4 cup corn starch for thickening, if desired</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
<li>In large soup pot, place broth, onions, celery and whole chicken and bring to boil.  Once boiling, lower heat to simmer and cook until chicken is falling apart.</li>
<li>Remove chicken to large bowl and set aside to cool.</li>
<li>Use colander to strain veggies out of broth.  Return broth to soup pot and bring back to boil uncovered.  <i>Be careful not to let broth boil too long or liquid will reduce in volume and you may need to add more broth later.</i></li>
<li>While broth is heating, unroll pie crust onto cutting board and cut into 1/2 to 1/4 inch wide 1 inch long strips.</li>
<li>Carefully drop pie crust strips into boiling broth and cook at rolling boil for 3-4 minutes.</li>
<li>Lower heat to med-low, return veggies to pot and simmer. </li>
<li>Once chicken is cool enough to handle, remove white meat and shred with fork.  Add shredded meat back to pot and stir.</li>
<li>Add milk and heavy cream and stir with whisk until completely blended.</li>
<li>Add seasonings to taste.</li>
<li>If desired, mix corn starch and equal amount warm water and add to pot to thicken liquid.</li>
</ol>
